## MEIGA-PAV

MEIGA-PAV is a computational method for the annotation of mobile element insertions (MEI) in a VCF containing structural variation (SV) calls. Although it has been designed to process SVs derived from the Phased Assembly Variant Caller (PAV; https://github.com/EichlerLab/pav), it should be compatible with the output of any long-read variant callers, as long as the sequence for insertion events is included in the VCF. 

MEIGA-PAV was developed for the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC)
